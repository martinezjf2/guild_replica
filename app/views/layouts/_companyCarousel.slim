Guild delivers on all of these needs through access to online classes, financial aid guidance, tuition assistance and a personal counselor to support each student in real time."

To me getting my degree is showing to others that you still can continue to thrive when the world sets other lower expectations based on events within your life. That you truly are in control of becoming whoever you want to be."
